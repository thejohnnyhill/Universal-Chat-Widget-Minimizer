# Universal Chat Widget Minimizer

This is a Boost for the [Arc browser](https://arc.net/) that **reduces the opacity of chat widgets across all websites,** because those things are annoying af (but you still might need to use one sometime).

It's pure CSS, so can also be used as a standalone userstyle in plugins like [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html).

Curently covers the following live chat integrations:
- [x] Beacon
